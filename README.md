# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to retrieve weather data from OpenWeather API based on a random list of cities (generated using random latitude/longitude coordinates from Python Random Module) and plot them onto a map using Google Maps Platform API.

To expand on the use of OpenWeather & Google Maps Platform APIs, I created a Python app that takes the userâ€™s desired min/max temperature to filter through the list of random cities. From there, the user can select the cities they want to visit and the app will use the Google Maps Platform API to plot the route to each city based on the closest hotel.
